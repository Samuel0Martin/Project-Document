### I added the beam to the player asset
### This is so I could get the location of the player and could work out where the fire point would be placed.

## Issues

### The quadratic curve on the beam did not properly work when I put in to the game.
### The bend point goes far off in to the distance.
### I was unable to fix this error so I removed it from the game.
