### Due to the lock down I was unable to keep up a steady and consistent working pace thus I did not get as much done as I could have.
### I could have been more active on team when checking messages and replying to them.
### Unity did not run as well as it did on the Polytech machines and that affected my progress in Unity aswell.
### There was alot that I learned from the particle system and Shader Graph in Unity.
### I can now create some interesting effects using these features of Unity.
