# Reflection

### During this semester I have learnt many features available with the particle system.
### I have made a few features using this particle system and understand how it works now. 
### I could have put in some more work to get some more features done.
### There were a few features that I was unable to find a way to get working correctly.
### I should have spent more time on these features and tryed to get them to work.
### I came back at a later pont and improved some of the early features, this could have been done sooner.
### Taking a note of everything that I have changed would have made merging the prohect alot easier.
