### Moving to updated unity version

### There were not many issues with moving the particles over and getting them to work.

### The only issue I had was with the rain on the camera.
### This is probably due to the lightning system being different in this version.

### I had to change the material for the camera rain a found a tutorial for it.
### I followed this tutorial to create a new material for the camera rain particles
### This is supposed to make them look transparent.
